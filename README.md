# Design-Patterns-JS

I'm in the process of learning JavaScript, and now i settled on Design Patterns.So, I decided to practice with the theory and keep it all here. For each pattern, i decided to come up some task or a small example, which would help me understand the pattern and try to do it.

In repository i have 2 folders: first folder with ES5 code and second with ES6+ code. I will try to implement scripts in both standards, sometimes using jquery or other libraries as well. In this two main folder will be folders with the names of the design patterns and each of these folders will have the simplest architecture possible, which will probably consist of several files.
